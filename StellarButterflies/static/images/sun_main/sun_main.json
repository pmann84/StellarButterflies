{"shorttext": "Image of a solar flare captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory", "text": "NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image of a solar flare - as seen in the bright flash on the lower right limb of the sun - at 8:12 p.m. EDT on Oct. 1, 2015. The image is a blend of three wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light that have been colorized. This flare is classified as an M5.5 class flare. M-class flares are a tenth the size of the most intense flares, the X-class flares. The number provides more information about its strength. An M2 is twice as intense as an M1, an M3 is three times as intense, etc.", "credits": "NASA/SDO", "srclink": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasas-sdo-sees-sun-emit-mid-level-flare-oct-1"}
